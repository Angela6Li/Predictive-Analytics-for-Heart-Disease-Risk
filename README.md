## Project Description
This project aims to identify the key indicators contributing to heart disease risk and develop predictive models to determine whether an individual is vulnerable to a heart disease. In this project, we will conduct exploratory data analytics and feature engineering to investigate various indicators. Additionally, we will build classification models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks, as taught in ORIE 5741.
